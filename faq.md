## What is flutter-view

Flutter-view is a tool for creating Flutter Dart code, meant to make it easier to make trees of widgets and style them.

## How does it work?

Flutter-view itself is an npm program that you run in a terminal window. It monitors your project's Pug, Sass, HTML and CSS files. When a file updates, it will create or update Dart files of the same name.

You use the Pug or HTML files to define flutter-views, which flutter-view will convert into Flutter Widget layout functions in Dart. You can them use these Dart functions in your normal Flutter code.

You can use the Sass or CSS files to add style properties to the widget trees.
